# Guess Number Game

![Guess number](https://i.ibb.co/HhBL67Z/ss.png)

Welcome to the Guess Number Game! This simple Python project challenges you to guess a random number between 1 and 100 in just 8 tries. The game will provide feedback, letting you know if your guess is higher or lower than the target number. It's a fun and interactive way to test your guessing skills.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-diegov/Guess_number.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Guess_number
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```
4. The game will start, and you will be prompted to make your first guess. Enter a number between 1 and 100.

5. You will receive feedback on whether your guess is higher or lower than the target number.

6. Continue guessing until you either find the correct number or run out of attempts (you have 8 tries).

7. After each guess, the game will inform you of the number of remaining attempts.

8. If you guess the number correctly, you win! If you run out of attempts, the game will reveal the secret number, and you can choose to play again.

## Game Features
